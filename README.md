# Boid Simulation
<i>This is a boid simulation made in Unity based on a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw&t=44s) in youtube by Sebastian League. <br>
This simulation has extra implementations like randomized behaviour and predator boids, but doesn't run on the GPU.</i><br>

## Points in a sphere surface:

This repository also contains a class covering the problem to **evenly distribute points in the surface of a sphere**.<br>
You can mess around with the **step angle values, radius and amount of points** you want do display and see the paterns that emerge. 

_*Obs: The angle that creates evenly-distributed points in the sphere surface is the **golden angle**, ~2.39996 in radians or 137.5ยบ._

This problem was also briefly discussed in **Sebastian's League youtube video**.
